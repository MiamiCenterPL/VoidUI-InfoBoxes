### HUD options
Each of the infobox type can go into different parts of the hud, and it's all customizable in options.

The main parts integrated deeply with Void UI are;
HUD Assault Corner (Top right corner) and HUD Objectives (Top left corner)
However you can also make up to 4 custom HUD spaces - static panels for your infoboxes to appear in.

In each infobox category (type) options catalog you can specify to which of the HUD parts you want then to appear in. You can also set their priority.

For custom HUD spaces you can also set how many infobox can go into each of the priority, possition on screen, alignment (Right, Left, Top, Bottom)

You can also set the infoboxes to be removed when their counter hits 0.

There's some more options you can play in if you want to, I am not going to explain anymore since you can find it all in game.
## Installation

First of all you need an mod loader;
- https://superblt.znix.xyz/
Then you need to install other mods that this mod is dependent on;
BeardLib (for Auto Updates - optional)
- https://github.com/simon-wh/PAYDAY-2-BeardLib
Void UI (Required!)
- https://modworkshop.net/mod/20997

Void UI Infoboxes, Void UI and BeardLib are mods and therefore you need to unpack them to the PAYDAY 2/mods folder.
